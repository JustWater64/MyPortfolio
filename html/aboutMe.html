            <p>
                I am a student at Neumont College of Computer Science, going for a Business Technology Management Degree.
                I am from a small town in Arizona called Bullhead City. It's practically a tourist town because we have the
                Colorado River that flows right through, but we'd mainly get californians and Nevada residents since Bullhead borders both Needles, CA
                and Laughlin, NV. I've lived in Bullhead City for as long as I can remember, though I have visited many different places in the United States like Los Angeles, CA,
                Las Vegas, NV, Washington D.C, VA, and louisville, KY. Hobbies I tend to enjoy are playing Video Games and building plastic models called Gunpla.
